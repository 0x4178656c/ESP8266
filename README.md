This repository was created with the intention of helping those who need it to setup their home automation laboratory.
The two files are different because "Con_remoto" allows you to remotely pilot an output with the publication on a topic of your choice.
In my case the topic will be "LED" and the message can be modified in the "callback" function

Hardware:
WeMos D1R2
DS18B20

The uploaded code is fully functional [21-03-2022]

NB: The WeMosD1R2 microcontroller is based on the ESP8266 chip. Personally I recommend this type of microcontroller because 
in addition to having the functionality of Arduino, it allows interaction with the network and all the possible resulting projects.
